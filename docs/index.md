## Post #1

This month we're doing something different and won't have a presentation. We're going to host a hack night where everyone is welcome to build, share, and learn together. Developers of all experience levels are welcome.

Bring your laptop and, optionally, a project to work on. Projects can range from something you're already working on to simply learning something like a new language with someone else. Still not sure what to work on? We'll have a few project ideas that people can get quickly get started with.

We'll get started by doing brief introductions where everyone gives their name and share what they'd like to work on for the night, or if they would prefer work with someone else. We'll then quickly assemble into groups and get going for the night. We'll also have a few extra people available to help out.

Please note that this is the first time we have hosted a Moncton UG meetup in this format.  If you have an questions or suggestions ahead of time, please email us: monctonug@cognitivex.com.

P.S.: Don't forget your laptop! =)
