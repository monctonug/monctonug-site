    text: "\r\n\r\nOn Friday May 6th. MonctonUG and Microsoft presents Moncton Azurefest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding
      the time to learn about the Cloud and how to extend your skills to build solutions
      for the Cloud can be a challenge when your schedule is defined by application
      build, test, and deployment milestones. With this type of schedule, chances
      are you find learning new concepts in one condensed sprint much easier than
      trying to squeeze some learning into an hour here and an hour, between your
      other tasks. If that’s the case for you, you’ll want to check out AzureFest,
      a hands-on educational event designed by Canada’s own MVPs Cory Fowler (@SyntaxC4)
      and Barry Gervin (@bgervin) from ObjectSharp.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt AzureFest, you’ll
      see how developing and deploying applications to Windows Azure is fast and easy,
      leveraging the skills you already have (.NET, Java, PHP, or Ruby) and the tools
      you already know (Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.).\r\n\r\nAzureFest sessions are
      delivered with examples using .NET and Visual Studio, but the concepts are the
      same regardless of the language and tools.\r\nYou’ll learn everything to you
      need to know to get up and running with Windows Azure quickly including:\r\n\r\nOverview
      of Cloud Computing and Windows Azure\r\nSetting up the Windows Azure SDK and
      Windows Azure Tools for Visual Studio\r\nSetting up your Windows Azure account\r\nMigrating
      a traditional on-premise ASP.NET MVC application to the Cloud\r\nDeploying solutions
      to Windows Azure\r\n\r\nAzureFest is a hands-on event. This means that you’ll
      be following along in your own development environment and actually deploying
      your solution during the event. In order to get the most out of the experience,
      you’ll need to bring a laptop with you that is running Windows Vista SP1 or
      Windows 7 and has the Windows Azure Tools for Visual Studio installed.You’ll
      also need to bring a credit card. Windows Azure activations require a credit
      card even for the trial period, but don’t worry, nothing will be charged to
      your credit card as the last part of the event shows you how to take down all
      of your Windows Azure instances.\r\nRegistration\r\nYou can register for either
      event using this link. Please choose the “Afternoon” ticket or the “Evening”
      ticket accordingly\r\nhttp://monctonug-azurefest.eventbrite.com/\r\nDate and

      himself as a ‘Developer as a Service’. He is a Technology Community Leader,
      Mentor and Speaker that enjoys sharing his passion for Software Development
      with others. Cory has been awarded with a Microsoft MVP award for his Focus
      on Windows Azure (Microsoft’s Cloud Computing Platform). Even with his head
      in the Clouds, Cory finds himself developing a wide range of Solutions including
      but not limited to Websites (with ASP.NET MVC & Silverlight), Windows Phone
      7 Applications (with Silverlight & XNA) and other solutions using the C# Programming
      Language. Even though Cory works primarily on the Microsoft Stack, he has worked
