      Microsoft has released another cloud service named Azure Machine Learning (#AzureML).  Machine Learning (ML) is a hot topic in the big data world.  With so much data, gathering insight into patterns and extracting value can be challenging.
       
      AzureML comes with a drag and drop type web interface to easily put the pieces of the puzzle together to come up insights based on complex data sets.
       
      Grasping everything that's going on in behind the scenes can be a bit challenging as mastering ML involves a relatively steep learning curve, but AzureML provides an intuitive interface to help guide people in using the service.
       
      It provides support to upload your own scripts in the R programming language (with Python apparently coming soon).
       
      Once you've created your model, you can either keep it for private use (using keys) or make it public by publishing it in the Azure marketplace for others to use in their own services or applications.
       
      In this session, we will discuss ML, then explore AzureML, and use the ever so well-known Titanic survivor data set to develop a model and test its effectiveness in predicting whether a person will survive the disaster.
