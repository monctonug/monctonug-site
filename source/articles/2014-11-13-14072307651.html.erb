    text: "Microsoft has released another cloud service named Azure Machine Learning
      (#AzureML).  Machine Learning (ML) is a hot topic in the big data world.  With
      so much data, gathering insight into patterns and extracting value can be challenging.\r\n \r\nAzureML
      comes with a drag and drop type web interface to easily put the pieces of the
      puzzle together to come up insights based on complex data sets.\r\n \r\nGrasping
      everything that's going on in behind the scenes can be a bit challenging as
      mastering ML involves a relatively steep learning curve, but AzureML provides
      an intuitive interface to help guide people in using the service.\r\n \r\nIt
      provides support to upload your own scripts in the R programming language (with
      Python apparently coming soon).\r\n \r\nOnce you've created your model, you
      can either keep it for private use (using keys) or make it public by publishing
      it in the Azure marketplace for others to use in their own services or applications.\r\n \r\nIn
      this session, we will discuss ML, then explore AzureML, and use the ever so
      well-known Titanic survivor data set to develop a model and test its effectiveness
      in predicting whether a person will survive the disaster."
