      \nVincent Roy / Always Be Sharpening Your Saw Tools & Workflows \nDescription:
      In this live presentation I am going to show you some tricks, tools and workflows
      that I use to make my life easier (read: I'm lazy). It will range from debugging
      tools, text editing to tools that I use to communicate with my team. The goal
      is not to sell you my tools but to encourage you to explore *your* tools. \nPaul
      Duncan / Let's talk office ergonomics \n ***upfront disclaimer: I do not have
      any qualifications or certificates re: office ergonomics but I do have a wealth
      of experience, having been plagued by various aches and pains throughout my
      professional life.  We'll talk about topics such as workstation setup; chair;
      peripherals. I'll also talk about some of the different types of treatment that
      you could try to help keep things from tensing up. \n  \nLooking forward to
      seeing you there. "
