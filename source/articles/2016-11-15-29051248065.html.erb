      Have you ever asked the question, "How can I be a better software developer?"  Or, "What will it take to get to the next level as a dev.?"
      In our next meeting, we'll attempt to answer those questions (and more) about all aspects of software development, including, but not limited to: gathering requirements, planning, coding, deployment, and support.  We will also attempt to focus on how the answers to these questions change when one is coding as a freelancer vs. a start-up vs. a larger organisation vs. etc.
      We are putting together a panel of experienced developers with varied experiences that will help lead the conversation by sharing their knowledge and possibly a story or two. We also strongly encourage questions and input from the group at large.
