      Presentation Summary
      Rapid and runaway success is the best way to expose all of the gaps, rough edges and pain points in your back end services. Under live-site pressure to fix issues, making the crucial set of engineering choices and investments can be challenging.  This session will take a hands-on walk through scaling a representative back-end application (written with .NET Core and Kubernetes on Azure) from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of requests per second, illustrating data, techniques, and common performance barriers from real customer deployments.
      Speaker Biography
      Mark Simms is a Partner Architect on the Azure engineering team, responsible for architectural guidance, delivery remediation, and technical stewardship for critical customer projects at scale.  Prior to joining Microsoft, Mark was the CTO of a mobile application startup, working on everything from embedded digital design to live site operations for a SaaS platform.
