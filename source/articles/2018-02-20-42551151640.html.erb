      Presentation Summary
      Best practices for design patterns: KISS, DRY, SOLID.  You all know these, but they could be far from being part of your daily activities.  What you might see every day might instead be "God-class," duplicate code, unnecessary complexity, feature-envy and many other terrible practises.  "Code smell" is a generic term to group these under one keyword, but in most cases it indicates an issue with the design and a disregard for common best practices.  Let's try to identify these, list them, and suggest solutions with some examples.
