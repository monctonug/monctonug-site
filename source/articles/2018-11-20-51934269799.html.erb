      Presentation Summaries
      Vincent Roy:  Infrastructure Workflow with Terraform
      HashiCorp Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared among team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.
      Paul Brooker:  Real-time Data Migration in Real-life
      We will cover how Alongside planned and implemented a large scale legacy data migration with no interruption of services for the largest job board service in Atlantic Canada.  Topics will range from initial planning stages to actual implementation of our final solutions and a brief overview of results.
      Speaker Biographies
      Vincent Roy is a full stack software developer with just under 10 years of experience. In that time he's had a chance to work with various technologies from backend services written in Ruby on Rails to browser applications written using CoffeeScript.  He is currently a Senior Software Engineer at EMC writing backend and infrastructure services in Java, Python, JavaScript and Go.During the past three decades, Paul Brooker's career has undergone almost as many regenerations as Dr. Who. His current incarnation is a Web Developer for Alongside, where he can find himself in any part of the web stack at any given time. Paul volunteers some of his spare time to Startup Weekend NB and the technology council of Oulton College, of which he is an alumnus.
