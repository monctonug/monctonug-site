description: "<h2>Presentation Summary</h2><p>In September 2019, Microsoft announced
  .NET Core 3.0, an important milestone in the transition from the .NET Framework,
  a proprietary, closed source, Windows-only platform to an open source, multi-platform
  framework.  It brought with it support for desktop development, C# 8, and enhancements
  to ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. </p><p>In this talk, we will look at the benefits
  of .NET Core (focused on ASP.NET Core) for existing .NET Developers as well as the
  development community as a whole and take a look at the more exciting features of
  the platform (gRPC support, Blazor, enhancements to Identity, C# 8 features)â€¦ using
  Visual Studio for Mac, deploying to and debugging in a Docker container.</p><h2>Speaker
  Biography</h2><p><strong>Adam Greene</strong> started programming at age 16 on an
  NEC V20. Over the last 20 years, he has filled a variety of roles including Tech
  Lead and CTO for a variety of companies, and now is enjoying his time working remotely
  as a Senior Software Engineer for Cvent focused on .NET technologies. Adam has worked
  in a variety of languages and platforms and has been an avid fan of .NET for almost
  18 years (starting with .NET 1.1).</p><p></p>"
